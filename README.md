Publishing my workings for Kaggle's house price prediction problem.

The problem and dataset can be found on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-data-for-ml-course/overview.<br>
At the time of submission, my latest solution was ranked in the top 5% of all submissions.

My solution involves using Random Forest Regression and XGBoost models to predict the prices of the test data.<br>
In arriving at my solution, I perform EDA, apply appropriate data transformation and feature engineering techniques, and finetune hyperparameters.
